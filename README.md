# Reviews-analysis
AI21 Lab Hackathon | Evalu8

# Project Title

## Summary

Evalu8 is an advanced artificial intelligence-powered tool for reviewing customer feedback. It is based on the state-of-the-art AI21 Lab Jurassic Park model and is specifically designed to take in reviews of a particular product or service. Evalu8 analyzes the reviews based on pre-defined prompts such as price, speed of delivery, comfortability, and material quality that are expected from reviews of that particular category. After analyzing the reviews, it performs sentiment analysis based on these prompts, providing a more accurate and nuanced understanding of customer feedback. The reviews are then scored on a scale of zero to five, with zero being the worst and five being the best. This scoring system allows businesses to easily compare and contrast feedback and make data-driven decisions to improve their offerings and drive growth. Additionally, Evalu8 can be used by prospective customers to make informed decisions on products that will best suit their needs based on the reviews and scores provided by Evalu8.
